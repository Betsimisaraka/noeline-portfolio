I'm Noeline Marie, a front-end developer based in Madagascar.

I mainly work with HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript and React, TypeScript and especially love working with React Native.

I love challenging my current knowledge and contributing to meaningful technology that people value.

The two and a half incredible years of English and coding at <a class="onja" href="https://onja.org/">Onja</a> was a real eye-opener for me to see what I can do to make the world and Madagascar a better place as a web developer.
