I'm Noeline Marie, a front-end developer based in Madagascar.

I am specialized in HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript and React.

I love challenging my current knowledge and hope to discover more of what the world of web development can offer.

The two and a half incredible years of English and coding at Onja was a real eye-opener for me to see what I can do to make the world and Madagascar a better place as a web developer.
