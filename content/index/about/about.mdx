I'm Noeline Marie, a web developer focusing on front-end development based in Madagascar.

There is nothing more to be thankful than able to do what we love to do. I have figured out that being a coding is not just what I want but what I love.

I am so pleased that [Onja](https://onja.org/) has given me the opportunity to be a developer.
