This project is built with react native. Find it on <a class="link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learngasy&hl=en&gl=US">google play store</a> and start learning Malagasy! It is an application that helps people to learn both English and Malagasy. In a team of three developers, I worked on building the components and some of the UI, where I used a storybook to test the components. Together we implemented the functionalities.
